This repository contains the data and code used to obtain the results obtained while testing the plane wave and reciprocity transfer function methods using both simulation and experiment.


MATLAB files:
•	Files of transfer functions – real and imaginary
o	Plane wave simulation
o	Loop coil simulation with background signal
o	Reciprocity simulation
o	Loop coil experiments with background signal
o	Reciprocity experiment
•	Files of piX128HP loop coil excitor
o	Reflection coefficient
o	Capacitor voltage
o	Electric field FWHM
•	Code that plots all data used in reports
•	Code for plotting circuit analysis of excitor
